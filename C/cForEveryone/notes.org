*** Introduction

Operating systems, languages and applications are built upon C.
Study C not aas a programming language, but as a plaftform on which modern programming languages are built.

*** History of C

C was developed to address bytes rather an words (in computers) from Bell labs.
In 1978, almost everything changed.
C evolved hand in hand with Unix portability.

C is a great systems programming language. It is not a great general purpose language.
Lack of solid dynamic memory support and no string type variables in C.
Python is a great general purpose language.
C++ is just a more powerful, flexible and intricate version of C.
Java, JS, Python, C# are powerful languages, but they aren't close to bare metal, as they said.
A layer of abstraction is added on top to keep them away from the hardware.
Rust is probably the best successor to C.
Rust has to be stable, mature and dependable.
