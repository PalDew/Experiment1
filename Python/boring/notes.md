# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python

## Introduction

Story about author.
There was a problem of comparing prices of many products across many retailers.
I think this is an example of what sort of flavor to expect from this book.

List of promised projects:
 - Moving and renaming thousands of files and sorting them into folders.
 - Filling out online forms - no typing required
 - Downloading files of copying text from a website whenever it updates
 - Having your computer text your custom notifications
 - Updating or Fromatting Excel spreadsheets
 - Checking your email and sending out prewritten responses.

## What is programming

If someone says programming is something other than talking to a computer and giving it instruction.
Typically there are certain actions like manipulating memory, creating/editing data types, if-else statements,
mathematical operations, reading user inputs, automating manual processes, changing permissions,
etc, that are considered programming. 

## Python
It is rumored to be based on Monty Python (the British Comedian Group) rather than the animal.
Programmers need to know quite a lot of math sure.
But math won't help them with all problems. Take sudoku for example.

A basic statement is called an expresison in python.
Values are what is stored as constant/variables.

Assigning and Overwriting a value to a variable is done via = sign.

Naming of variables:
    - can be only alphanumeric aand _ 
    - Can not start with a number
    - No spaces allowed
    - can't be the name of default defined functions.
    - Case sensitive

## Writing Programs and Bult-in funcitons
 - The input() function asks the user for an input. The type is string by default.
 - You can change the type initially too by using int(input()).

## Types of Error Encountered
- TypeError: Combining or doing operations in data of different types, often which are not comparable.
