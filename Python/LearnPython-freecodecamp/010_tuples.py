# A touple is just an ordered set of data. This means that the contents, their types and their order cannot be changed.
# They call it immutable
# if you try to assign some other value to any index, python throw will throw an error
## Create a touple (say co-ordinates)
coordinates = (4, 5)
# remember that lists are enclosed in [] while a touple in ()

print("The X coordinate is:" ,coordinates[0])
print("The Y coordinate is:" ,coordinates[1])


# This is the only difference, python-wise.
## We use tuples for storing data.
