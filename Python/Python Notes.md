### Concepts Learnt
Dynamically typed language
Interpreted, not compiled
+ operator can be used to join strings.
* operator can be used to repeat strings.
Expressions are most basic units of programming instruction. They can always evaluate down to a single value.
Statements are more generalized form. Any instruction that results in an action can be termed as a statement. It has to have a valid syntax and meaning though.
